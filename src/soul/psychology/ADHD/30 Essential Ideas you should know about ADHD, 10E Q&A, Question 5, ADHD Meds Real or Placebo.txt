Do you believe that the effect ADHD medication
has is real or just a placebo?

Okay there are more than 400 studies
of the stimulants

there are additional studies of the other drugs
like atomoxetine

they're all placebo-controlled,

the placebo rate in most studies
is between 10 and 35 percent

the rate of responders to the active medication
is between 55 and 92 percent

averaging to about 75 percent
so it's twice the placebo rate

so at this point we can be assured
from these randomized placebo-controlled

studies that the medication has a real effect

not just an effective psychological suggestibility

as the placebo effect might suggest

so all i can tell you those studies have been done
they've been done repeatedly

and we can be assured this is not a placebo effect

it doesn't mean there isn't a little bit of a placebo effect

but most of the effect is clearly that of an active agent
