Does the rule of a 30% reduction in maturity
also apply to when a child is on medication?

Does the 30% rule apply to children on medication?

No because in 55% to 65% of the cases of children
the medication will normalize them

so that is over a half
and in some cases two-thirds

(with those kids, the 55% to 65%)
the thirty percent (maturity delay) is gone

only when the medication is active
so at the end of the day here it comes

and by eight o'clock at night
your back to 30% again

so just keep in mind
that it can normalize some children


in the remaining 30%
the gap is closed but not completely

there's improvement but not normalization

other things will have to be done
to help with that gap

and then there's about 10% to 15%
percent of the kids

who don't respond to any particular agent

and in that case 
you are just going to have to deal

with the full 30%
and accommodate it as best you can

so good question!
