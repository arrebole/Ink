What is the best way to deal with
teachers and other parents

when your child has acted out emotionally
and created a negative situation?

Well I don't know that there's one best way
because

let's face it there are some neighbors
or some parents of other friends

who aren't going to respond to anything

and they don't want your kid around

and it's best for your child
find another set of friends

or stay away from that home

they don't need to be hearing that stuff

but most parents are fairly reasonable people

and I think if you went to them

if you downloaded a fact sheet

on ADHD from my website
or the CHADD.org website

and you just took it to them
this sort of 2 to 3 page description

or you call them 
and say I been meaning to come by

or have you over for coffee

or as part of this little social coffee klatch whatever

you introduce this information

about your child
about their diagnosis about what it is

and the various things that you are all
trying to do to contend with it

I think you might find these people
being more compassionate

than they ordinarily would

they're probably laboring under
a lot of misimpressions

that the public has anyway

that this your child could be better

this is your fault 
it's a result of parenting

and we so need to sort of disabuse
them of those ideas but

I like the honesty is the best policy
approach to begin with

now obviously if in the middle
of this conversation it becomes very clear

that these parents don't care don't
understand and don't want to

then you that you should not be allowing
your child to play at their home or

under their supervision

feel free to invite their child
over to your house

if they will allow it
but I i still think informing the public

we've had some teenagers
carry around a card about ADHD

in their wallet so that
they can show it to people

who are not familiar with ADHD
a coach or a policeman

who pull him over for speeding
or you know something like that

but

very much like ...
we got the idea from the

Tourette Syndrome Foundation

which publishes small cards
that are information

to allow Tourette's people
to share the information

without necessarily having
to explain it all themselves

but here's a sheet from a reputable
source like CHADD or my website

that that they can learn from the most
you can do is to try to persuade them

inform them maybe change their mind

and then the rest is shopping for

more reasonable friends
and parents or friends if you can

now some people ask what will

my child doesn't have an awful lot of
friends what what can I do

to try to improve that

make your house the best place to play on the street

its bribery
but I don't care how you do it

yet you need to have the best toys in
the yard

you need to have the best games 
in the house

you need to be somebody who
feeds all visitors

so that when everybody

anybody shows up
man there's a fudgesicle in your hand

and an Oreo in a glass of milk and

here's the Wii system

in I mean you're just gonna create this

place where they love being there
whether your son is there or not

and hopefully some of these
friendships will stick or take or

they'll be a little more for giving up
your child inmaturities

because you're such a great place to be

however you can arrange this enviroment

you can't make other children like your child
that is not possible to do

you can only make them more likeable

or make the environment
in which your child exists more likable

and hopefully some of that sticks

so approach it that way

but you can't make another child want to
play with your child

just not going to happen
those children make their own choices
