But interestingly
30% to 50% of the children

who are now called inattentive type
probably have a different disorder

and researchers have called them SCT
(Sluggish Cognitive Tempo)

it's about 30% to 50%
of all inattentive type children

and we now believe this is a
qualitatively unique disorder

the debate now is whether
this is a separate type of ADHD

a point with which I disagree
or

is it a qualitatively separate disorder
a point with which I agree

why would I view this
as a different disorder

first of all the symptoms
are the opposite of ADHD

but you won't see them
anywhere in the DSM

but these are the
most compelling symptoms that go with SCT

but because these children
also have an attention problem

there is no place else to put them

because ADHD is the only
attention disorder in the DSM

so they get dropped into ADHD

even though they have
no symptoms in common with it

these individuals have a problem
with processing information

which ADHD children do not have

these children have trouble with
focused attention

choosing what important from what's not

ADHD children do not
their problem is and persistence

these people may have a
long-term memory storage problem

or it could just be the
same attention problem

that appears
when they searched their memory

what is quite distinct about them
is that they are socially withdrawn

reticent shy apprehensive

and often prone to social anxiety

but certainly socially reticent
is a very good word for them

this is not a word that would ever
be applied to an ADHD child

most importantly and tellingly
they do not have an inhibition disorder

and inhibition is the heart of ADHD

and therefore they do not have a
self-regulation disorder

and ADHD is a self regulation disorder

and these individuals do not have
the executive deficits

that I just listed for you 
that go with ADHD

for those reasons alone

you could argue that
this is a distinct disorder

but there are others

there is a very low rate of
oppositional and conduct disorder

associated with this type of child

ODD and CD are
much more common in ADHD children

these children have more anxiety problems

ADHD children while 1 in 4
may have anxiety

it's far higher in this group

we're not sure if depression
goes with this group

both groups have about a
20% to 25% risk of depression

but it doesn't distinguish
the two disorders

when we interview families
of these children

their parents are concerned
only about school

nothing else

these are good kids
not disruptive outside of school

they even have a few friends
not as many as other children

but more than ADHD children
will ever have

so the big concern is
let's get that school work done

and the mistakes they're making in school

you interview the parent of an ADHD child
they're worried about everything

peer relationships
family functioning

community behavior

not to mention what happens
as the teen gets older

and starts driving
and having a job

and managing money
and becoming sexually active

SCT families
don't worry about any of that stuff

ADHD families worry
and well they should

(audience laughter)

these children mainly have trouble
with the accuracy of school work

they get all the work done
and half of its wrong

ADHD children don't do any work
(audience laughter)

so the difference

SCT is an accuracy disorder
ADHD is a productivity disorder

that is a qualitative difference
another one is that these children

may be more prone to math disorders
but we're not sure about that

these children
come from quite different families

families
with the same kinds of problems

higher rates of anxiety

higher rates of
learning problems in school

thats about it

children with ADHD
come from families with a lot more ADHD

a lot more school failure
a lot more anti-social behaviour

alcoholism
depression and drug abuse

these children do not

when we look at the treatments
that work for these children

and this has not
been very well studied by the way

but even here
differences appear

the medications for ADHD
don't work very well for these children

they don't hurt them
you can try them

the lowest doses are the best
they just don't help them

in fact in our study
only 1 in 5 children was kept on

their medication after the trial
in ADHD its 92%

these children are the
best responders to social skills training

but no surprise
social skills training was invented

40 years ago for shy people

and we know it works best
for shy people

not for aggressive people

and so these children actually do
very well in social skills training

ADHD children do not do well
at all in social skills training

if they do
it needs to be done

in the school environment
with the children they go to school with

not in a summer camp

and certainly
not in some Saturday morning clinic

with other children
they will never see again

the rest of their life

if you're doing that
you're probably wasting your money

so if they benefit
it's because they benefit by the teachers

and others doing the training
outside of the clinic environment

in the natural setting
where the social problems arise

and even then
it's not so much the skill training

as prompting and cueing
and rewarding the occurrence of the skill

now do be aware

that research now shows
that 1 in 4 children

put in a social skills group
will be made worse by the group

this is known as deviancy training
and it happens to occur because

the more aggressive children
in any peer group

will train up the less aggressive children

to become more aggressive
if only in self-defence

it happens every kindergarten year
to normal children as well

so clinicians need to be careful
because there are side effects

to social interventions

25% of ADHD children get worse
by being in a social skills group

and we wish to avoid that

now the MTA study has found

that anxiety is the best predictor of
response to the behavioral interventions

we could argue therefore that
SCT children are probably the

best responders to behavior modification
even better than ADHD children are

we know the cognitive therapy

which is teaching children
to talk to themselves

fails for ADHD

we know why now because the
minds voice is not developing on time

and in order for talking to yourself
to have any success

you must have a
normally developing internal speech

and they don't
at least not until adulthood

and then some cognitive training does help
as a supplement to medication

but in childhood
cognitive training doesn't help ADHD

but this isn't ADHD
so shouldn't we revisit this

and do cognitive training for SCT

no one has done it

there's a dissertation
you know somebody who wants a dissertation

I just gave you one
(audience laughter)

what about medication

well we don't know

we know the stimulants
aren't particularly wonderful for them

they don't hurt them
but they don't help them all that much

what else might work

well I don't know honestly
but let me conjecture

if I were writing a grant tomorrow
I might speculate

that Strattera (Atomoxetine)
might work for these children

only because these
are more anxious children

and Strattera treats anxiety
when it's coexists with ADHD

so maybe Atomoxetine
might have a shot at this disorder

we don't know
nobody's done it

another drug that might be interesting
is Provigil (Modafinil)

Modafinil is an anti narcoleptic

and it does seem to help people with ADHD
it might help this group even more

because you remember those symptoms
I showed you two slides ago

does that sound a 
little narcoleptic to you

lethargic slow-moving

drowsy staring inattentive

Humph maybe a brain stem drug
might help you

again all speculative
we don't know

by the way that is all we do know on SCT

so please don't ask me
anymore questions about it

because you now
know everything I know

what I do want you to know as a family
is to understand that's not ADHD

ADHD is quite different from that

and so if you happen to have an SCT child
or you know someone who does

please don't tell them
to read the books on ADHD

they will be sadly misinformed

they will be told of all kinds of risks
and all kinds of treatments

which as far as we know
have little if any application

to these children

there is no book for parents on SCT
not yet

nor should there be
we don't know enough

but researchers are now
studying these children

the very first
psychological treatments for SCT

were published about a year ago

at the University of California
at San Francisco

and so we're now beginning to see
more and more research

on SCT children
as distinct from ADHD children

but what I would want a family
of an SCT child to understand

is that this is not ADHD

so what you should be
worried about are not the things

families with ADHD children
should be worried about

it's pretty much going to be a
school-based issue

and the treatments
that don't work for those kids

might well work for your child

and the treatment that do work
for those kids

such as medication
might not be so great for your child

no harm
but not necessarily so great
