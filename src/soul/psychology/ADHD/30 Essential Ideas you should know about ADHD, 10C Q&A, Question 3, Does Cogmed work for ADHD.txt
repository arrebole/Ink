What are your thoughts on Cogmed
to increase working memory?

There are a number of treatments
on the market right now that are based on these

neuropsychological theories of ADHD

as an executive disorder particularly
that involves working memory

Torkel Klingberg is the developer of Cogmed

he is a Swedish scientist

Cogmed is working memory training

it is practicing digit-span
forward and backwards

and spatial memory
forward and backward

for about 45 minutes a day with your child

you do need to reward them
because it gets boring to tears

after the first day or two

so you have to have a token system
a reward program in place

(The) program cost several thousand dollars.

Now I have visiited Sweden and his lab.

I've gone over their data and

it does look like this produces a
temporary improvement in working memory

and that results in a temporary decrease
in ADHD symptoms

but even Klingberg has shown
that with 3 months of training

or up to 6 months of training
the effect might last maybe three months

and then you have to 
start the retraining again so

so this is,
he likening it I think very aptly

to an athlete, like a weight lifter
trying to train muscle mass

this isn't anything willful
you're just trying to expand the capacity

of the brain for working memory

and just like an athlete who exercises
I can build up my biceps

but if I stop exercising for a month
guess what's going to happen

my bicep is gonna atrophy now
because it's not being exercised as much

and the same is true with these
neuropsychological training programs

that we've seen so far

now Klingberg
gets royalties from the company

and we would like to see his research replicated
by someone who does not have

a financial stake in the success of the company

so it is being tested at five universities

in the US
I know of at least one here in Canada as well

When these studies are over
we're gonna have an idea about whether

his findings could be replicated

but even if they are replicated
let's not forget what he found

this is a temporary exercising program
that has to be reinstituted

several times a year

to sustain the gains
now let me tell you something else

if it turns out that this works

why would you spend several thousand dollars

when you can buy a Nintendo DS
and the Brain Age software

which does both of these things as well,

and at least six other frontal lobe
executive function tasks

it's just as much fun
if not more so

its one-tenth the cost

so I would directed you to Nintendo
before I would say... send you to Cogmed

(audience laughs)
and if you do not want to invest

a couple hundred bucks, 
the cost of the DS with the software

(you can) get Scientific American Mind

This is the popular science magazine:
Scientific American

they also publish one called Scientific American Mind

The last issue of Mind

was a review of all internet sites
that have executive function training

programs on them

where you can go, some of them are free

most of them have a a monthly fee
that you can sign on for

and there's the software there's the games

there's tracking your successes and failures

all the things that Nintendo and Cogmed
are doing can be done through these websites

without buying the equipment

usually for like $9 or $10 bucks a months
some are more some are less

some are more interesting
some are less interesting

but there's a review of all these
brain training web sites in that magazine

and it's very good

by the way Nintendo comes out looking really good

because it's the only portable system
you can take anywhere and practice anytime

even if you're waiting in a car
for little league to start

you know

so up look around Cogmed
is not the only thing out there

but let's wait for the research to come
out before we know whether this is

really gonna turn out

to be a coping tool and that's all it is

it is not a cure
not by any means

that was probably
more information than you ever

wanted to hear
