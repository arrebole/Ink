Results of Untreated ADHD

So let me show you what
untreated ADHD

is likely to have
associated with it over time

this is from my own longitudinal study
and others

first of all school
is the major area of impairment

but we all know that

they're more likely be held back in school

a third of them quit high school
without finishing

only 5% to 10% ever finish college

so under education
is a classic ADHD impairment

but that of course is going to
lead to problems in the workplace

and you can see the ones
we've identified here

and it also gonna lead to
problems in driving

because we know that
the single biggest cause

of auto accidents
in the North American population

is in vehicle distraction
and this is a distractibility disorder

so no surprise
they are going to have problems

but they have problems at all levels of driving
as you see here

more speeding tickets
more car accidents

multiple accidents
worst accidents

and as a result

they are going to have their licenses
suspended three times more often

than other people

so driving becomes a major problem

in fact as has been said
there is no disorder

that interferes with driving
to the degree that ADHD does

so this is a major area of impairment

which is why your
Canadian Pediatric Association

has now recommended

that if pediatricians see a teenager
who's about to start driving

and they have ADHD
that at least moderate in severity

you need to medicate them
while they drive

I would say that that
should be the case

for nearly all
clinically referred people with ADHD

because if they're clinically referred
they probably at least have it

to a moderate to a severe degree
why is that

because you can kill yourself

and you can kill other people
as well with a motor vehicle

and we don't want to see that happening

now in addition to those 
there are some other areas of impairment

not the least of which
is managing money

as they move away from home

as they get jobs
as they get credit

as they borrow money
as they take our car loans

we start to see them 
having troubles paying their bills

paying them on time
so they get their utilities turned off

their cars repossessed
their credit rating is terrible

because you've given a
very impulsive person credit

(audience comment)
is their a pill for that?

(audience laughs)

boy could we use that these days

everybody working for AIG would go on this

but this is an area
that very few people took a look at

but duh I mean it makes perfect sense
when you phrase it

as a disorder of self control
given a credit card

and now we can understand what's going
to happen with the credit problem

so obviously they need more accountability
in their financial management

social problems
are going to continue into adulthood

for many though
not for all of them

they often as adults
describe themselves as having trouble

sustaining long-term relationships
particularly dating

and marital relationships
or partnering with people

and we will see that they
do experience divorce at a higher rate

then other people do
because of these difficulties

an area now that has been studied
more in detail

is the area of sexuality
we do not find more sexual disorders

so pedophilia
transvestisim or other difficulties

are not more common in this population

what we do find
as you would guess

knowing an impulsive person
is greater risky sexual acitivity

starting to have
intercourse a year earlier

than other teenagers
having more partners

because they don't stay
in dating relationships as long

not using contraception
because they're so impulsive

all of which leads to a
10x fold increase in teenage pregnancy

we now know in fact
there is no better predictor

of adolescent pregnancies than ADHD

in my study 32% of the boys
had fathered a child by 19

68% of the girls had been pregnant
at least once before 19 years of age

so this is a disorder that predispose
to becoming a parent very young

and by the way we saw the same thing
in the parents of these kids as well

and that's because
their parents have ADHD also

ADHD in adults
leads to earlier parenthood

than the general population would be experiencing

and then of course notice a 4x fold
increase in sexually transmitted disease

so we have a group of individuals

if who are not treated
are going to be experiencing impairments

in every major life activity
we have studied

there is no domain of life
free of the influence of ADHD

that we have yet identified

which is why we argue now
for longer-term treatment

across the week
across the year

and especially through adolescence
because

most children if they are on medication
its for 3 years or less

and if they're in treatment programs
it only for a few years or less

and what we have found in these studies

is that childhood only treatment
was useless

useless in terms of changing
the life course of these individuals
