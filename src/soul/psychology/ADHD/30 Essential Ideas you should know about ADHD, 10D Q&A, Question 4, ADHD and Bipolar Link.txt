Lately a connection seems to have been found
between ADHD and Bi-Polar disorder,

what are your thoughts on
co-morbidity and misdiagnosis?

All right here is the relationship, alright

the relationship between
ADHD and bipolar is a one way street

ADHD children carry no elevated risk
for bipolar disorder over that of the general population

no longitudinal studies have found that
to be the case my own included

not the Canadian Studies
not the New York studies

not the Iowa not the Swedish not the Australian

(the bipolar) risk is 2 to 4%
which is the population rate

so if a child starts out ADHD
that's probably what they're going to stay

bipolar becomes a very remote diagnosis

however,
if there is bipolar disorder in the family

the risk goes up 8 times

now
the real relationship is from bipolar to ADHD

if a child has bipolar disorder ... already
and it started in childhood

the risk is 80 to 97%
that they will have ADHD along with it

and that is why the confusion
people saw that so many bipolar children had ADHD

they made the leap
that the opposite had to be true

that ADHD was a big risk for bipolar
and it turned out to be no risk for bipolar disorder

unless the family history of bipolar illness is there

and then the genetic risk for bipolar disorder
obviously are what mediate that high risk

so bipolar disorder only 
if it starts in childhood

carries a very high risk for ADHD along with it

and ADHD is usually the first disorder to start

if the bipolar starts in adolescence
the risk is 40 to 45% that ADHD is (co-morbid) with it.

if it starts in adulthood
which is the more typical form of bipolar disorder

the risk is only 20 to 25%

so notice it's the early-onset bipolar
that brings the risk of ADHD with it

not the other way around

now if there's bipolar there
and it started in childhood

it is one of the worst psychiatric disorders
a child can have

barring infantile autism
or schizophrenia

very difficult to manage
it requires multiple medications to try to deal with it

there's obviously an increased risk of
not just destructiveness

but violent behavior
particularly in males

there's periodic hospitalization for safety
as well as for

re-engineering the psychopharmacology
that is testing the drugs

many of the drugs used with

bipolar disorder have far more serious side effects
than the ADHD drugs do

and so children are often hospitalized,

partly to monitor the side effects
as they are titrating them

the bipolar child has a massive increase
in risk for suicide and drug abuse

as they enter adolescence

so this is not a fun disorder

but it is 2 to 3% roughly of children

have the bipolar disorder and it is severe

and it is usually lifelong

and it often requires poly-pharmacy
and periodic hospitalization

so the news isn't good

but at least we can say ADHD
is not a cause of bipolar disorder

most ADHD children are never at risk for it

but if there's a family genetic link to bipolar

then that young child with ADHD
may also carry that link and that risk
