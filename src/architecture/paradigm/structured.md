# STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING 结构化编程

> 结构化编程对程序控制权的直接转移进行了限制和规范。

结构化编程是第一个普遍被采用的编程范式（但是却不是第一个被提出的），由 `Edsger Wybe Dijkstra` 于 `1968` 年最先提出。与此同时，`Dijkstra` 还论证了使用 `goto` 这样的无限制跳转语句将会损害程序的整体结构。正是这位 `Dijkstra` 最先主张用我们现在熟知的 `if/then/else` 语句和 `do/while/until` 语句来代替跳转语句的。

## begin

Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was born in Rotterdam in 1930. He survived the bombing of Rotterdam during World War II, along with the German occupation of the Netherlands, and in 1948 graduated from high school with the highest possible marks in math, physics, chemistry, and biology. In March 1952, at the age of 21 (and just 9 months before I was born), Dijkstra took a job with the Mathematical Center of Amsterdam as the Netherlands’ very first programmer.

> Edsger Wybe Dijkstra 于 1930 年出生在荷兰鹿特丹。生于乱世，他亲身经历了第二次世界大战中的鹿特丹大轰炸、德国占领荷兰等事件。1948 年，他以数学、物理、化学以及生物全满分的成绩高中毕业。1952 年 3 月，年仅 21 岁的 Dijkstra （此时距离我出生还有 9 个月时间）入职荷兰阿姆斯特丹数学中心，成为了荷兰的第一个程序员。

In 1955, having been a programmer for three years, and while still a student, Dijkstra concluded that the intellectual challenge of programming was greater than the intellectual challenge of theoretical physics. As a result, he chose programming as his long-term career.

> 1955 年，在从事编程工作 3 年之后，当时还是一个学生的 Dijkstra 就认为编程相比理论物理更有挑战性，因此他选择将编程作为终身职业。

In 1957, Dijkstra married Maria Debets. At the time, you had to state your profession as part of the marriage rites in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities were unwilling to accept “programmer” as Dijkstra’s profession; they had never heard of such a profession. To satisfy them, Dijkstra settled for “theoretical physicist” as his job title.

> 1957 年，Dijkstra 与 Maria Debets 结婚了。在当时的荷兰，新郎新娘必须在结婚仪式上公布自己的职业。而当时的荷兰官方政府拒绝承认“程序员”这一职业，因为他们从来没有听说过。最终 Dijkstra 不得不继续使用"理论物理学家这一职位名称。

As part of deciding to make programming his career, Dijkstra conferred with his boss, Adriaan van Wijngaarden. Dijkstra was concerned that no one had identified a discipline, or science, of programming, and that he would therefore not be taken seriously. His boss replied that Dijkstra might very well be one of the people who would discover such disciplines, thereby evolving software into a science.

> Dijkstra 和他的老板 Adriaan van Wijingaarden 曾经讨论过将“程序员”当作终身职业这件事，Dijkstra 最担心的是由于没有人认真地对待过编程这件事或者将它当作是一门学术学科对待，他的科研成果可能将不会得到认真对待。而 Adriaan 则建议 Dijkstra：为什么不亲自去开创这门学科呢?

Dijkstra started his career in the era of vacuum tubes, when computers were huge, fragile, slow, unreliable, and (by today’s standards) extremely limited. In those early years, programs were written in binary, or in very crude assembly language. Input took the physical form of paper tape or punched cards. The edit/compile/test loop was hours—if not days—long.

> 当时还是真空管阶段。计算机体积巨大，运行缓慢，还非常容易出故障，功能（与今天对比）十分有限。人们还是直接使用二进制数，或者使用非常原始的汇编语言编程。计算机的输入方式则还是用纸卷带或者是打孔卡片。要想执行完整的编辑、编译、测试流程是非常耗时的，通常需要数小时或者数天才能完成。

It was in this primitive environment that Dijkstra made his great discoveries.

> Dijkstra 就是在这样原始的条件下做出其非凡的成就的。

## PROOF 可推导性

The problem that Dijkstra recognized, early on, was that programming is hard, and that programmers don’t do it very well. A program of any complexity contains too many details for a human brain to manage without help. Overlooking just one small detail results in programs that may seem to work, but fail in surprising ways.

> Dijkstra 很早就得出的结论是：编程是一项难度很大的活动。一段程序无论复杂与否，都包含了很多的细节信息。如果没有工具的帮助，这些细节的信息是远远超过一个程序员的认知能力范围的。而在一段程序中，哪怕仅仅是一个小细节的错误，也会造成整个程序出错。

Dijkstra’s solution was to apply the mathematical discipline of proof. His vision was the construction of a Euclidian hierarchy of postulates, theorems, corollaries, and lemmas. Dijkstra thought that programmers could use that hierarchy the way mathematicians do. In other words, programmers would use proven structures, and tie them together with code that they would then prove correct themselves.

> Dijkstra 提出的解决方案是采用数学推导方法。他的想法是借鉴数学中的公理（Postulate）、定理（Theorem）、推论（Corollary）和引理（Lemma），形成一种欧几里得结构。Dijkstra 认为程序员可以像数学家一样对自己的程序进行推理证明。换句话说，程序员可以用代码将一些已证明可用的结构串联起来，只要自行证明这些额外代码是正确的，就可以推导出整个程序的正确性。

Of course, to get this going, Dijkstra realized that he would have to demonstrate the technique for writing basic proofs of simple algorithms. This he found to be quite challenging.

> 当然，在这之前，必须先展示如何推导证明简单算法的正确性，这本身就是一件极具挑战性的工作。

During his investigation, Dijkstra discovered that certain uses of goto statements prevent modules from being decomposed recursively into smaller and smaller units, thereby preventing use of the divide-and-conquer approach necessary for reasonable proofs.

> Dijkstra 在研究过程中发现了一个问题：goto 语句的某些用法会导致某个模块 无法被递归拆分成更小的、可证明的单元，这会导致无法采用分解法来将大型问题进一步拆分成更小的、可证明的部分。

Other uses of goto, however, did not have this problem. Dijkstra realized that these “good” uses of goto corresponded to simple selection and iteration control structures such as if/then/else and do/while. Modules that used only those kinds of control structures could be recursively subdivided into provable units.

> goto 语句的其他用法虽然不会导致这种问题，但是 Dijkstra 意识到它们的实际效果其实和更简单的分支结构 if-then-else 以及循环结构 do-while 是一致的。如果代码中只采用了这两类控制结构，则一定可以将程序分解成更小的、可证明的单元。

Dijkstra knew that those control structures, when combined with sequential execution, were special. They had been identified two years before by Böhm and Jacopini, who proved that all programs can be constructed from just three structures: sequence, selection, and iteration.

> 事实上，Dijkstra 很早就知道将这些控制结构与顺序结构的程序组合起来很有用。因为在两年前，Bohm 和 Jocopini 刚刚证明了人们可以用顺序结构、分支结构、循环结构这三种结构构造出任何程序。

This discovery was remarkable: The very control structures that made a module provable were the same minimum set of control structures from which all programs can be built. Thus structured programming was born.

> 这个发现非常重要：因为它证明了我们构建可推导模块所需要的控制结构集与构建所有程序所需的控制结构集的最小集是等同的。这样—来，结构化编程就诞生了。

Dijkstra showed that sequential statements could be proved correct through simple enumeration. The technique mathematically traced the inputs of the sequence to the outputs of the sequence. This approach was no different from any normal mathematical proof.

> Dijkstra 展示了顺序结构的正确性可以通过枚举法证明，其过程与其他一般的数学推导过程是一样的：针对序列中的每个输入，跟踪其对应的输出值的变化就可以了。

Dijkstra tackled selection through reapplication of enumeration. Each path through the selection was enumerated. If both paths eventually produced appropriate mathematical results, then the proof was solid.

> 同样的，Dijkstra 利用枚举法又证明了分支结构的可推导性。因为我们只要能用枚举法证明分支结构中每条路径的正确性，自然就可以推导出分支结构本身的正确性。

Iteration was a bit different. To prove an iteration correct, Dijkstra had to use induction. He proved the case for 1 by enumeration. Then he proved the case that if N was assumed correct, N + 1 was correct, again by enumeration. He also proved the starting and ending criteria of the iteration by enumeration.

> 循环结构的证明过程则有所不同，为了证明一段循环程序的正确性，Dijkstra 需要采用数学归纳法。具体来说就是，首先要用枚举法证明循环 1 次的正确性。接下来再证明如果循环 N 次是正确的，那么循环 N+1 次也同样也是正确的。最后还要用枚举法证明循环结构的起始与结束条件的正确性。

Such proofs were laborious and complex—but they were proofs. With their development, the idea that a Euclidean hierarchy of theorems could be constructed seemed reachable.

> 尽管这些证明过程本身非常复杂和繁琐，但确实是完备的。有了这样的证明过程，用欧几里得层级构造定理的方式来验证程序正确性的目标，貌似近在咫尺了。

## A HARMFUL PROCLAMATION goto 是有害的

In 1968, Dijkstra wrote a letter to the editor of CACM, which was published in the March issue. The title of this letter was “Go To Statement Considered Harmful.” The article outlined his position on the three control structures.

> 1968 年，Dijkstra 曾经给 CACM 的编辑写过一封信。这封信后来发表于 CACM 3 月刊，标题是 Go To Statement Considered Harmful，Dijkstra 在信中具体描绘了他对三种控制结构的看法。

And the programming world caught fire. Back then we didn’t have an Internet, so people couldn’t post nasty memes of Dijkstra, and they couldn’t flame him online. But they could, and they did, write letters to the editors of many published journals.

> 这可捅了个大篓子。由于当时还没有互联网，大家还不能直接上网发帖来对 Dijkstra 进行冷嘲热讽，他们唯一能做的，也是大部分人的选择，就是不停地给各种公开发表的报刊的编辑们写信。

Those letters weren’t necessarily all polite. Some were intensely negative; others voiced strong support for his position. And so the battle was joined, ultimately to last about a decade.

> 可想而知，有的信件的措辞并不那么友善，甚至是非常负面的。但是，也不乏强烈支持者。总之，这场火热的争论持续了超过 10 年。

Eventually the argument petered out. The reason was simple: Dijkstra had won. As computer languages evolved, the goto statement moved ever rearward, until it all but disappeared. Most modern languages do not have a goto statement—and, of course, LISP never did.

> 当然，这场辩论最终还是逐渐停止了。原因很简单：Dijkstra 是对的。随着编程语言的演进，goto 语句的重要性越来越小，最终甚至消失了。如今大部分的现代编程语言中都已经没有了 goto 语句。哦，对了，LISP 里从来就没有过！

Nowadays we are all structured programmers, though not necessarily by choice. It’s just that our languages don’t give us the option to use undisciplined direct transfer of control.

> 现如今，无论是否自愿，我们都是结构化编程范式的践行者了，因为我们用的编程语言基本上都已经禁止了不受限制的直接控制转移语句。

Some may point to named breaks in Java or exceptions as goto analogs. In fact, these structures are not the utterly unrestricted transfers of control that older languages like Fortran or COBOL once had. Indeed, even languages that still support the goto keyword often restrict the target to within the scope of the current function.

> 或许有些人会指出，Java 中的带命名的 break 语句或者 Exception 都和 goto 很类似。这些语法结构与老的编程语言（类似 FORTRAN 和 COBOL）中的完全无限制的 goto 语句根本不一样。就算那些还支持 goto 关键词的编程语言也通常限制了 goto 的目标不能超出当前函数范围。

## FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION 功能性降解拆分

Structured programming allows modules to be recursively decomposed into provable units, which in turn means that modules can be functionally decomposed. That is, you can take a large-scale problem statement and decompose it into high-level functions. Each of those functions can then be decomposed into lower-level functions, ad infinitum. Moreover, each of those decomposed functions can be represented using the restricted control structures of structured programming.

> 既然结构化编程范式可将模块递归降解拆分为可推导的单元，这就意味着模块了可以按功能进行降解拆分。这样一来，我们就可以将一个大型问题拆分为一系列高级函数的组合，而这些高级函数各自又可以继续被拆分为一系列低级函数，如此无限递归。更重要的是，每个被拆分出来的函数也都可以用结构化编程范式来书写。

Building on this foundation, disciplines such as structured analysis and structured design became popular in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. Men like Ed Yourdon, Larry Constantine, Tom DeMarco, and Meilir Page-Jones promoted and popularized these techniques throughout that period. By following these disciplines, programmers could break down large proposed systems into modules and components that could be further broken down into tiny provable functions.

> 以此为理论基础，在 20 世纪 70 年代晚期到 10 年代中期出现的结构化分析与结构化设计工作才能广为人知。Ed Yourdon、Larry Constantine、Tom DeMarco 以及 Meilir Page Jones 在这期间为此做了很多推广工作。通过采用这些技巧，程序员可以将大型系统设计拆分成模块和组件，而这些模块和组件最终可以拆分为更小的、可证明的函数。

## NO FORMAL PROOFS 形式化证明没有发生

But the proofs never came. The Euclidean hierarchy of theorems was never built. And programmers at large never saw the benefits of working through the laborious process of formally proving each and every little function correct. In the end, Dijkstra’s dream faded and died. Few of today’s programmers believe that formal proofs are an appropriate way to produce high-quality software.

> 但是，人人都用完整的形式化证明的一天没有到来。大部分人不会真的按照欧几里得结构为每个小函数书写冗长复杂的正确性证明过程。Dijkstra 的梦想最终并没有实现。没有几个程序员会认为形式化验证是产出高质量软件的必备条件。

Of course, formal, Euclidian style, mathematical proofs are not the only strategy for proving something correct. Another highly successful strategy is the scientific method.

> 当然，形式化的、欧几里得式的数学推导证明并不是证明结构化编程正确性的唯一手段。下面我们来看另外一个十分成功的策略：科学证明法。

## SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE 科学来救场

Science is fundamentally different from mathematics, in that scientific theories and laws cannot be proven correct. I cannot prove to you that Newton’s second law of motion, F = ma, or law of gravity, F = Gm1m2/r2, are correct. I can demonstrate these laws to you, and I can make measurements that show them correct to many decimal places, but I cannot prove them in the sense of a mathematical proof. No matter how many experiments I conduct or how much empirical evidence I gather, there is always the chance that some experiment will show that those laws of motion and gravity are incorrect.

> 科学和数学在证明方法上有着根本性的不同，科学理论和科学定律通常是无法被证明的，譬如我们并没有办法证明牛顿第二运动定律 F=ma 或者万有引力定律 F=Gm1m2/r^2 是正确的，但我们可以用实际案例来演示这些定律的正确性，并通过高精度测量来证明当相关精度达到小数点后多少位时，被测量对象仍然一直满足这个定律。但我们始终没有办法像用数学方法一样推导出这个定律。而且，不管我们进行多少次正确的实验，也无法排除今后会存在某一次实验可以推翻牛顿第二运动定律与万有引力定律的可能性。

That is the nature of scientific theories and laws: They are falsifiable but not provable.

> 这就是科学理论和科学定律的特点：它们可以被证伪，但是没有办法被证明。

And yet we bet our lives on these laws every day. Every time you get into a car, you bet your life that F = ma is a reliable description of the way the world works. Every time you take a step, you bet your health and safety that F = Gm1m2/r2 is correct.

> 但是我们仍然每天都在依赖这些定律生活。开车的时候，我们就等于是在用性命担保 F=ma 是对世界运转方式的一个可靠的描述。每当我们迈出一步的时候，和等于在亲身证明 F=Gm1m2/r^2 是正确的。

Science does not work by proving statements true, but rather by proving statements false. Those statements that we cannot prove false, after much effort, we deem to be true enough for our purposes.

> 科学方法论不需要证明某条结论是正确的，只需要想办法证明它是错误的。如果某个结论经过一定的努力无法证伪，我们则认为它在当下是足够正确的。

Of course, not all statements are provable. The statement “This is a lie” is neither true nor false. It is one of the simplest examples of a statement that is not provable.

> 当然，不是所有的结论都可以被证明或者证伪的。举一个最简单的不可证明的例子：“这句话是假的”，非真也非伪。

Ultimately, we can say that mathematics is the discipline of proving provable statements true. Science, in contrast, is the discipline of proving provable statements false.

> 最终，我们可以说数学是要将可证明的结论证明，而与之相反，科学研究则是要将可证明的结论证伪。

## TESTS 测试

Dijkstra once said, “Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.” In other words, a program can be proven incorrect by a test, but it cannot be proven correct. All that tests can do, after sufficient testing effort, is allow us to deem a program to be correct enough for our purposes.

> Dijkstra 曾经说过“测试只能展示 Bug 的存在，并不能证明不存在 Bug”，换句话说，一段程序可以由一个测试来证明其错误性，但是却不能被证明是正确的。测试的作用是让我们得出某段程序已经足够实现当前目标这一结论。

The implications of this fact are stunning. Software development is not a mathematical endeavor, even though it seems to manipulate mathematical constructs. Rather, software is like a science. We show correctness by failing to prove incorrectness, despite our best efforts.

> 这一事实所带来的影响是惊人的。软件开发虽然看起来是在操作很多数学结构，其实不是一个数学研究过程。恰恰相反，软件开发更像是一门科学研究学科，我们通过无法证伪来证明软件的正确性。

Such proofs of incorrectness can be applied only to provable programs. A program that is not provable—due to unrestrained use of goto, for example—cannot be deemed correct no matter how many tests are applied to it.

> 注意，这种证伪过程只能应用于可证明的程序上。某段程序如果是不可证明的，例如，其中采用了不加限制的 goto 语句，那么无论我们为它写多少测试，也不能够证明其正确性。

Structured programming forces us to recursively decompose a program into a set of small provable functions. We can then use tests to try to prove those small provable functions incorrect. If such tests fail to prove incorrectness, then we deem the functions to be correct enough for our purposes.

> 结构化编程范式促使我们先将一段程序递归降解为一系列可证明的小函数，然后再编写相关的测试来试图证明这些函数是错误的。如果这些测试无法证伪这些函数，那么我们就可以认为这些函数是足够正确的，进而推导整个程序是正确的。

## CONCLUSION 本章小结

It is this ability to create falsifiable units of programming that makes structured programming valuable today. This is the reason that modern languages do not typically support unrestrained goto statements. Moreover, at the architectural level, this is why we still consider functional decomposition to be one of our best practices.

> 结构化编程范式中最有价值的地方就是，它赋予了我们创造可证伪程序单元的能力。这就是为什么现代编程语言一般不支持无限制的 goto 语句。更重要的是，这也是为什么在架构设计领域，功能性降解拆分仍然是最佳实践之一。

At every level, from the smallest function to the largest component, software is like a science and, therefore, is driven by falsifiability. Software architects strive to define modules, components, and services that are easily falsifiable (testable). To do so, they employ restrictive disciplines similar to structured programming, albeit at a much higher level.

> 无论在哪一个层面上，从最小的函数到最大组件，软件开发的过程都和科学研究非常类似，它们都是由证伪驱动的。软件架构师需要定义可以方便地进行证伪（测试）的模块、组件以及服务。为了达到这个目的，他们需要将类似结构化编程的限制方法应用在更高的层面上。

It is those restrictive disciplines that we will study in some detail in the chapters to come.

> 我们在接下来的章节中将会深入研究这些限制性的方法。
